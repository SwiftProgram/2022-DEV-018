# TicTacToe

A classic TicTacToe game.

- Play.
- Win.
- Play again.


## Implementation

- You can download, unarchive the code and run the code via Xcode. For executing the unit test you can use "Cmd + U"

## Technical Decisions

- storyboard UI with swift
- MVVM Architecture is used 


## Rules

- X always goes first.
- Players cannot play on a played position.
- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
- One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
- All nine squares are filled.
- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.


## Unit test Cases

- Test cases are for ViewModel and ViewController
